Soccer Data Insights: Information Retrieval Models <br>
This repository contains my capstone project focused on extracting meaningful insights from soccer data through Information Retrieval (IR) queries. The project demonstrates the application of IR techniques to provide detailed player information and competition outcomes, with a focus on user-friendly visualization and interpretation.

Features
IR Query 1: Player Details
Query: Search for a player's name to retrieve their details.
Outcome: Displays information such as:
Player Position
Current Club
Dominant Foot
Last Season Played
Market Valuation
IR Query 2: Competitions and Teams
Query: Retrieve the number of competitions held and identify the winning and runner-up teams in a specified year.
Outcome: Provides a summary of notable tournaments, including winners and runners-up for the year.
Visualization
Both queries include visualizations to make the results more interpretable.

Implementation Details
I developed a website using HTML and JavaScript to interact with the data:

Soccer data stored in .csv format was converted to JSON for seamless use in JavaScript.
The website is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access:

Key Highlights
Player Information Retrieval: Enables users to search for players and view their professional details.
Winners and Runners by Year: Provides insights into the outcomes of major European and international soccer tournaments in a given year.
Feel free to explore the project or contribute!
