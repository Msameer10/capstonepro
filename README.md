# Soccer Data Insights: Information Retrieval Models

Welcome to the repository for my capstone project, *Soccer Data Insights*. This project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from soccer data using Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. It combines efficient data querying with user-friendly visualization to provide detailed player profiles and competition outcomes.
